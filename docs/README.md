# Chat Framework Boilerplate Documentation

This document outlines the architecture and requirements for a chat framework boilerplate designed for rapid web application development with AI capabilities.

## Overview

The chat framework serves as a foundational boilerplate for applications, featuring a chat user interface (UI) at its core. The framework leverages Vercel's AI SDK and utilizes predefined large language models (LLMs) for intelligent interactions.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (chat UI)
- Tailwind CSS (styling and UI components)
- Vercel AI SDK (AI integration)

### Backend
- MongoDB (data storage)
- AWS (backend workers)
- Google BigQuery (SQL database needs)
- Vercel (deployment and hosting)

## Core Data Structures

### 1. Blocks
- Fundamental units of information organization
- Can exist independently or within containers
- Utilizes block mapping for managing extensive information sets
- Supports context window management

### 2. Containers
- Higher-level organizational structures
- Examples:
  - Boards containing cards
  - Notebooks containing notes
- Provides hierarchical data management

### 3. Learnings
- Searchable knowledge base
- AI-accessible during chat interactions
- Available for future agent operations

### 4. Events and Logs
- System activity tracking
- Categories:
  - Agent-generated autonomous events
  - Platform activity logs
  - System operations logs

### 5. Messages
- Tracks all user-AI interactions
- Stores:
  - Model information
  - Input prompts
  - Generated responses
  - Associated metadata

## Input/Output System

### Input Tracking
- Sources:
  - Computer systems
  - Manual user entry
  - Chat interactions
- Each input includes source attribution

### Output Tracking
- Destination tracking for all system outputs
- Response type categorization
- Performance metrics collection

## User Interface Components

### Sidebar Navigation
- Collapsible design
- Features:
  - Chat selection
  - Feature navigation
  - Data type toggling
- Real-time updates without page refresh

## Tool Registry

### Structure
- Defined tool interfaces
- Standardized access patterns
- Extensible design for future additions

### Implementation Options
- Code-based registry
- Database-stored registry
- Hybrid approach for flexibility

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Maintain modular architecture
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Follow consistent coding standards
4. Document all major components
5. Include unit tests for core functionality

### Security Considerations
1. Implement proper authentication
2. Secure data transmission
3. Regular security audits
4. Compliance with data protection regulations
