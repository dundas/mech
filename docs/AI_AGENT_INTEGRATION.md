# AI Agent Integration with Repository Execution Environment

> **Document Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20  
> **Status**: Implemented  

## Overview

The AI Agent integration provides context-aware assistance directly within the repository execution environment. This integration combines the power of WebContainer-based code execution with intelligent AI assistance, creating a development environment similar to Cursor, GitHub Copilot Workspace, and other AI-powered development tools.

## Architecture Integration

### Repository-Centric AI Context

The AI agent operates within the **repository-centric architecture**, providing assistance that is:

- **Repository-Scoped**: All AI interactions are confined to the current repository context
- **Execution-Aware**: The AI has real-time access to execution results, build outputs, and error logs
- **Configuration-Conscious**: The AI understands repository configuration, environment variables, and build commands
- **Framework-Specific**: Provides tailored advice based on detected language and framework

```

## User Experience

### Enhanced Execute Button Workflow

When users click the **Execute** button on a repository:

1. **Repository Execution Starts**: WebContainer spins up with repository configuration
2. **AI Assistant Becomes Available**: New "AI Assistant" tab appears in the execution panel
3. **Context-Aware Chat**: AI has immediate access to:
   - Repository metadata (name, branch, language, framework)
   - Build and start commands
   - Environment variables
   - Real-time execution results
   - Error logs and build output

#### Context-Aware Prompt Engineering

The AI assistant uses a comprehensive system prompt that includes:

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant specialized in helping developers with repository execution, debugging, and optimization. You have access to the following repository context:

Repository Information:
- Name: ${repository.name} (${repository.fullName})
- Branch: ${repository.branch}
- Language: ${repository.language || 'Unknown'}
- Framework: ${repository.framework || 'Unknown'}
- Status: ${repository.status}

Configuration:
- Build Command: ${repository.buildCommand || 'Not configured'}
- Start Command: ${repository.startCommand || 'Not configured'}
- Environment Variables: ${JSON.stringify(environmentVariables, null, 2)}

${executionResult ? `
Execution Results:
- Success: ${executionResult.success}
- Output: ${executionResult.output}
- Error: ${executionResult.error || 'None'}
- Build Output: ${executionResult.buildOutput || 'None'}
` : 'No execution results available yet.'}

Please provide helpful, specific advice based on this context.`;
```

## Example Interactions

### Debugging Scenario

**User**: "Help me debug this execution error"

**AI Response** (with failed execution context):
```
I can see there's an execution error. Based on the error output: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'react'", here are some suggestions:

1. Check if all dependencies are properly installed
2. Verify your package.json includes react as a dependency
3. Try running `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Ensure your build command "npm run build" is appropriate for your Next.js project
5. Check if the port 3000 is available

Would you like me to help you analyze the specific error in more detail?
```

### Optimization Scenario

**User**: "How can I optimize my build configuration?"

**AI Response**:
```
Here are some optimization suggestions for my-nextjs-app:

1. **Build Configuration**: Your current build command is "npm run build". For Next.js, consider:
   - Adding `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` to environment variables
   - Using `npm run build && npm run export` for static exports
   - Enabling SWC compiler optimizations

2. **Environment Variables**: You have 3 environment variables configured. Consider:
   - Adding `NODE_ENV=production` for production builds
   - Setting `NEXT_OPTIMIZE_FONTS=true` for font optimization

3. **Performance**: Consider adding:
   - Build caching with `NEXT_CACHE_DIR=.next/cache`
   - Parallel builds if using multiple repositories

Would you like me to focus on any specific area?
```

### Environment Configuration

**User**: "What environment variables should I add?"

**AI Response**:
```
Your repository has 2 environment variables configured:
- NODE_ENV: development
- PORT: 3000

For a Next.js application, consider adding:
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (disable telemetry)
- `NEXT_OPTIMIZE_FONTS=true` (optimize font loading)
- `NEXT_OPTIMIZE_IMAGES=true` (optimize image loading)
- `DATABASE_URL` (if using a database)
- `API_BASE_URL` (for external API calls)

Is there a specific environment variable you'd like to add, modify, or troubleshoot?
```
