## Services Deployed & Monitored

| Service | Port | Domain | Status |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| mech-queue | 3002 | queue.mech.is | ✅ Operational |
| mech-llms | 3008 | llm.mech.is | ✅ Operational |
| mech-storage | 3007 | storage.mech.is | ✅ Operational |
| mech-indexer | 3005 | indexer.mech.is | ✅ Operational |

| mech-reader | 3001 | reader.mech.is | ✅ Operational |
| mech-memories | 3010 | memories.mech.is | ✅ Operational |

## Production Infrastructure

- **Server**: 207.148.31.73 (Vultr)
- **Docker Registry**: derivativelabs (Docker Hub)
- **DNS**: mech.is (Cloudflare managed)
- **SSL**: Cloudflare Flexible mode
- **Monitoring**: Automated health checks every 5 minutes

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Feature Commits**: Run the remaining parts of `organize-features.sh`
2. **Push to Remote**: Push organized feature branches
3. **Create Pull Requests**: For each feature group
4. **Deploy Updates**: Using the new deployment scripts
5. **Monitor**: Use the new monitoring framework

## Files Not Yet Organized

Some files may need manual review:
- Build artifacts in `dist/` directories
- Log files that were modified
- Temporary test files
- Generated configuration files

## Cleanup Recommendations

1. Remove log files from version control
2. Add proper .gitignore entries for build artifacts
3. Archive old deployment scripts
4. Consolidate duplicate test files
5. Remove temporary debugging files

## Success Metrics

The organization achieves:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Logical feature grouping
- ✅ Clean commit history
- ✅ Easy review process
- ✅ Maintainable codebase
