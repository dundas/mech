# Remote Indexer Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Remote URL**: http://mech-indexer-8.eastus.azurecontainer.io:3000  
**Status**: âœ… Running

## Current State

The mech-indexer service is running remotely on Azure Container Instances, but:
- **Service Status**: Healthy and accessible
- **MongoDB**: Connected
- **Indexed Content**: Currently empty for MECH project

## Important Note

The remote indexer is operational but doesn't have the MECH codebase indexed yet. This means:
- The `search_code` tool will return empty results
- Code search functionality won't work for self-improvement

## Options

### Option 1: Use Without Code Search
MECH AI can still self-improve using:
- `read_file` - Direct file reading
- `list_files` - Directory exploration  
- `analyze_project` - Project structure analysis
- All other tools work normally

### Option 2: Index Locally (Temporary)
If code search is needed:
```bash
# Start local indexer
cd mech-indexer
npm run api:simple

# Update the frontend to use local indexer
export NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_API_URL=http://localhost:3003

# Index the codebase
npm run index:local -- --path=/Users/kefentse/dev_env/mech
```

### Option 3: Index on Remote (Requires Access)
The remote indexer would need to be able to access and index the MECH codebase, which requires:
- Pushing code to a repository the indexer can access
- Or implementing a local-to-remote indexing pipeline

## Current Recommendation

For self-improvement MVP testing, proceed without code search. The other 12 tools provide sufficient capability for MECH AI to:
- Navigate the codebase with `list_files`
- Read specific files with `read_file`
- Analyze structure with `analyze_project`
- Make improvements with `write_file`
- Test changes with `run_tests`

The code search is helpful but not essential for basic self-improvement.
