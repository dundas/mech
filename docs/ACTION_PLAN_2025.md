# MECH AI Platform - Action Plan 2025

**Created**: May 27, 2025  
**Priority**: High  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Fix architectural confusion, complete proper implementations, and establish a solid foundation for the MECH AI platform.

## ðŸ“‹ Week 1: Architecture Clarification & Documentation

### Day 1-2: Tool Architecture Audit
- [ ] Map all existing tools and their locations
- [ ] Identify which tools are UI vs execution
- [ ] Document the current tool execution flow
- [ ] Create visual diagrams of the architecture

### Day 3-4: Establish Proper Structure
- [ ] Create `/mech-ai/agent/` directory for AI tools
- [ ] Create `/mech-ai/agent/tools/` for tool implementations
- [ ] Set up proper TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create tool interface definitions

### Day 5: Documentation Sprint
- [ ] Update all architecture documentation
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Document tool development patterns
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## ðŸ“‹ Week 2: Fix Core Issues

### Day 1-2: Logger Integration Fixes
```typescript
// Fix the logger integration properly
- [ ] Fix syntax errors in existing implementations
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Create logger configuration module
- [ ] Test logger with all environments
```

### Day 3-4: Tool Migration
- [ ] Move execution logic from frontend to agent tools
- [ ] Create proper agent tool implementations:
  - [ ] analyze-project (agent version)
  - [ ] health-check (agent version)  
  - [ ] write-file (agent version)
- [ ] Ensure frontend tools only handle display

### Day 5: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Test tool execution flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify approval flows work correctly
- [ ] Test logger integration with real service

## ðŸ“‹ Week 3: Self-Improvement Implementation

### Day 1-2: Self-Improvement Environment
- [ ] Set up proper sandbox for AI testing
- [ ] Create self-improvement tool suite
- [ ] Document self-improvement patterns
- [ ] Create success metrics

### Day 3-4: Re-run Self-Improvement Test
- [ ] AI attempts self-improvement in correct location
- [ ] Verify AI can modify its own tools
- [ ] Test deployment of AI changes
- [ ] Document results and learnings

### Day 5: Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance metrics to all tools
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Create alerting for failures
- [ ] Optimize slow operations

## ðŸ“‹ Week 4: Production Readiness

### Day 1-2: Security Audit
- [ ] Review all approval flows
- [ ] Audit tool permissions
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### Day 3-4: Load Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Load test all endpoints
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement caching where needed
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks

### Day 5: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Final documentation review
- [ ] Create operation runbooks

## ðŸš€ Quick Wins (Can do immediately)

### 1. Fix TypeScript Errors
```bash
cd /mech-ai/frontend
npm run lint -- --fix
npm run type-check
```

### 2. Create Basic Integration Test
```javascript
// test-basic-flow.js
const testAuth = async () => {
  console.log('Testing authentication...');
  // Add test code
};

const testProjectCreation = async () => {
  console.log('Testing project creation...');
  // Add test code
};

const testToolExecution = async () => {
  console.log('Testing tool execution...');
  // Add test code
};

// Run all tests
(async () => {
  await testAuth();
  await testProjectCreation();
  await testToolExecution();
})();
```

### 3. Document Current Tool Locations
```markdown
# Current Tool Inventory

## Frontend Tools (UI Only)
- Location: /mech-ai/frontend/lib/tools/
- Purpose: Display and user interaction
- Tools:
  - read-file.ts
  - write-file.ts
  - health-check.ts
  - analyze-project.ts (empty)

## Agent Tools (Execution)
- Location: TBD (needs creation)
- Purpose: Actual operations
- Tools: Need migration

## MCP Tools (Protocol)
- Location: /services/unified-mcp-service/
- Purpose: Standardized interface
- Tools: Various MCP implementations
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success:
- Clear documentation of entire architecture
- All tools mapped and categorized
- Development patterns established

### Week 2 Success:
- All TypeScript errors fixed
- Logger integration working
- Tools properly separated (UI vs execution)

### Week 3 Success:
- AI successfully self-improves in correct location
- Performance metrics implemented
- Monitoring in place

### Week 4 Success:
- Security audit passed
- Load testing completed
- Production deployment ready

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

1. **Today**: 
   - Review this action plan
   - Start tool architecture audit
   - Fix any critical bugs blocking progress

2. **Tomorrow**:
