# Multi-Agent Coordination System

## Current Agent Status

### Active Agents
- ðŸ”’ **Security & Infrastructure Agent**: READY
- ðŸš€ **Service Deployment Agent**: READY  
- ðŸ§ª **Quality & Validation Agent**: READY
- ðŸ“š **Documentation & Operations Agent**: READY

## Shared State Documents

### Current System Status
- **Infrastructure**: Vultr server 207.148.31.73 operational
- **DNS**: All *.mech.is domains configured correctly
- **Security**: All credentials rotated and secure (2024-12-18)
- **Services**: 8/8 services deployed and operational

### Communication Protocol

#### Agent Coordination Matrix
| Task Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents | Approval Required |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Security Changes | Security & Infrastructure | All | None |
| Service Deployments | Service Deployment | Quality, Security | Security clearance |
| Quality Issues | Quality & Validation | All | Can halt deployments |
| Documentation Updates | Documentation & Operations | All | None |

#### Escalation Procedures
1. **Security Incident**: Security Agent leads, all agents support
2. **Service Outage**: Deployment Agent leads, Quality validates recovery
3. **Quality Failure**: Quality Agent can halt any operation
4. **Documentation Gap**: Documentation Agent coordinates updates

## Current Active Tasks

### In Progress
- [ ] **Security Agent**: Quarterly security audit scheduled
- [ ] **Deployment Agent**: Performance optimization pending
- [ ] **Quality Agent**: 24h post-deployment monitoring
- [ ] **Documentation Agent**: API reference updates

### Completed Today
- âœ… All services successfully deployed to production
- âœ… DNS records updated and propagated
- âœ… Security credentials rotated and validated
- âœ… Multi-agent system established

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Daily Standup (Virtual)
Each agent updates their status in shared documents:
- `SECURITY_STATUS.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` 
- `QUALITY_STATUS.md`
- `DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md`

### Decision Making Process
1. **Proposal**: Any agent can propose changes
2. **Review**: Affected agents review and comment
3. **Approval**: Primary agent for domain approves
4. **Execution**: Coordinated execution across agents
5. **Validation**: Quality agent validates results
6. **Documentation**: Documentation agent captures process

### Emergency Response
- **Alert**: Any agent detecting issues sends immediate alert
- **Assembly**: All agents acknowledge and assess impact
- **Leadership**: Most qualified agent takes lead based on issue type
- **Support**: Other agents provide supporting actions
- **Resolution**: Coordinated response until issue resolved
- **Post-mortem**: Documentation agent facilitates lessons learned

## Next Scheduled Activities

### This Week
- **Monday**: Security audit completion
- **Tuesday**: Performance optimization deployment
- **Wednesday**: Documentation review cycle

### Issue Escalation Format
```markdown
## ESCALATION: [ISSUE_TITLE]

**Severity**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
**Primary Agent**: [Agent responsible]
**Supporting Agents**: [Agents needed]

**Issue Description**: 
Clear description of the problem

**Impact**:
What is affected and how

**Proposed Resolution**:
Recommended actions

**Timeline**:
When this needs to be resolved

**Dependencies**:
What other agents need to do
```

## Workflow Orchestration

### Standard Deployment Workflow
1. **Security Agent**: Pre-deployment security check
2. **Deployment Agent**: Execute deployment procedure  
3. **Quality Agent**: Validate deployment success
4. **Documentation Agent**: Update deployment records

### Incident Response Workflow  
1. **Detection**: Any agent identifies issue
2. **Alert**: Immediate notification to all agents
3. **Assessment**: Primary agent assesses severity
4. **Response**: Coordinated response based on incident type
5. **Resolution**: Continue until issue fully resolved
6. **Documentation**: Capture incident and response for learning

### Change Management Workflow
1. **Proposal**: Agent proposes change with rationale
2. **Impact Assessment**: All agents assess impact on their domain
3. **Approval**: Get required approvals based on change type
4. **Implementation**: Execute change with coordination
5. **Validation**: Verify change achieved desired outcome
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and procedures

This coordination system ensures all agents work together effectively while maintaining their specialized focus areas and clear accountability.
