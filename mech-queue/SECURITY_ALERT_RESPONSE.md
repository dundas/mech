# URGENT: DigitalOcean Security Alert Response

## Issue
DigitalOcean has detected an exposed Redis instance on port 6379 on your droplet (138.197.15.235).

## Immediate Action Required

1. **SSH into the droplet immediately**:
```bash
ssh root@138.197.15.235
```

2. **Run the emergency security script**:
```bash
# Copy and run the security fix
scp scripts/secure-redis-emergency.sh root@138.197.15.235:/tmp/
ssh root@138.197.15.235 "bash /tmp/secure-redis-emergency.sh"
```

## Manual Fix (if script fails)

```bash
# SSH into droplet
ssh root@138.197.15.235

# 1. Stop and remove any Redis service
sudo systemctl stop redis
sudo systemctl disable redis
sudo apt-get remove -y redis-server redis-tools

# 2. Kill any process on port 6379
sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:6379)

# 3. Block port 6379 with firewall
sudo ufw deny 6379/tcp
sudo ufw --force enable

# 4. Remove any Redis containers
docker ps -a | grep redis | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r docker stop
docker ps -a | grep redis | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r docker rm

# 5. Verify port is closed
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 6379
# Should show nothing

# 6. Test from outside (should fail)
telnet 138.197.15.235 6379
```

## Root Cause
The droplet appears to have a Redis instance installed and running directly on the host, exposed to the internet without authentication.

## Proper Configuration
Your queue service should ONLY use DigitalOcean's managed Valkey database, never a local Redis instance.

## Verify Fix
1. Test that port 6379 is no longer accessible:
```bash
telnet 138.197.15.235 6379
# Should show "Connection refused" or timeout
```

2. Check firewall rules:
```bash
ssh root@138.197.15.235 "sudo ufw status"
```

3. Ensure queue service is using Valkey:
```bash
ssh root@138.197.15.235 "docker logs queue-service | tail -20"
```

## Response to DigitalOcean

After fixing, respond to the ticket:

"Thank you for the security alert. I have immediately addressed the issue:

1. Removed the exposed Redis instance from port 6379
2. Updated firewall rules to block port 6379
3. Verified the service is now using DigitalOcean's managed Valkey database
4. Confirmed port 6379 is no longer accessible from the internet

The issue has been resolved and the droplet is now secure."

## Prevention
1. Never install Redis directly on production droplets
2. Always use managed database services
3. Keep firewall rules restrictive
4. Regular security audits

This is a critical security issue - fix it immediately!
