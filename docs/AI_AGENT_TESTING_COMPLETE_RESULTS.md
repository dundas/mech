### **Test 5: Complete Self-Improvement Cycle** ✅ PASSED
**Objective**: Implement actual improvement based on analysis  
**Method**: Created standardized error handling utility  
**Result**: SUCCESS - Delivered production-ready improvement:

#### **Created: `error-handler.ts`**
- ✅ **Standardized Error Categorization**: 5 error types (validation, network, filesystem, git, unknown)
- ✅ **Intelligent Error Detection**: Pattern-based error classification
- ✅ **Helpful Suggestions**: Context-aware troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ **Data Stream Integration**: Real-time error reporting
- ✅ **Consistent Formatting**: Unified error and success result structures
- ✅ **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- ✅ **Convenience Functions**: Easy integration for existing tools

#### **Key Features Implemented**:
```typescript
// Automatic error categorization
Network errors → Service connectivity suggestions
File system errors → Permission and path guidance  
Git errors → Repository and configuration help
Validation errors → Parameter and format assistance

// Consistent result formatting
Success results: { status, tool, data, timestamp }
Error results: { status, tool, error: { type, message, suggestions } }

// Easy integration
const handler = new ToolErrorHandler({ toolName: 'my-tool', dataStream });
const result = handler.createSuccessResult(data);
```

**Assessment**: Successfully completed full self-improvement cycle from analysis to implementation.
